ViewFu
======

ViewFu is a Rails plugin that provides all the miscellaneous View tasks. It's a combination of the functionality of Styler, Javascripter, and Headline (from Patrick Crowley, the.railsi.st) - along with additional tweaks such as providing commonly used View Helpers Methods.

ViewFu HTML Helpers
=======
ViewFu provides helpers for commonly used html elements

br #=> <br />
hr #=> <hr />
anchor("posts") #=> <a name='posts'></a>
clear #=> <div class="clear"></div>
clear(:left) #=> <div class="clearleft"></div>
clear_tag(:br) #=> <br class="clear" />
lorem #=> Lorem ipsum dolor...


ViewFu Helper Queries
=======
production? #=> returns true if Rails.env == "production"
is_new? #=> returns true is we're on a "new" or "create" action
is_edit? #=> returns true is we're on an "edit" or "update" action
use_cache? #=> returns true if perform_caching is turned on


ViewFu Misc Helpers
=======
paging(@array) #=> display a will_paginate paging links (only if the array is a valid paging collection)
paging(@array, :sabros) #=> wrap the paging links with a class "sabros"


Haml Specific Helpers
=======
Haml allows you to pash a hash of attributes. ViewFu assists this by providing a simple "hidden" helper that allows you to conditionally hide page elements.

%div{hidden} #=> <div style="display:none">
%div.posts{hidden_if(@posts.empty?)} #=> hide the .posts div if the array is empty
%p.empty{hidden_unless(@posts.empty?)} #=> hide the empty posts message if the array has elements

Page Titles
=======
ViewFu allows you to easily set the current page title from anywhere on your views

title
Displays the current page title

title(new_title)
Sets the page title

See lib/headliner/README for more details

More Plugins

If you like ViewFu, you'll *love* FormFu. It provides a beautiful way to generate tableless Rails html forms. Works just like form_for, except it'll generate the entire XHTML (label, wrapper, validation message, etc).
